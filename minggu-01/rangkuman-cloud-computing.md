Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user. has functions spread over several locations, each location being a data center.

Value proposition Proponents of public and hybrid clouds note that cloud computing enables enterprises to avoid or minimize up-front IT infrastructure costs.

Proponents also claim that cloud computing enables enterprises to get their applications up and running faster, with increased manageability and less maintenance, and allows IT teams to more quickly adapt resources to meet fluctuating and unpredictable demands.

History emerged as early as 1996, with the first known mention of it in an internal Compaq document. The cloud symbol was used to represent a network of computing equipment in the original ARPANET as early as 1977.

The word cloud is used as a metaphor for the Internet and a standard cloud-like form is used to denote a network on a telephone scheme

Early history

2000s In July 2002, Amazon created the subsidiary Amazon Web Services, with the aim of "enabling developers to build their own innovative and entrepreneurial applications." In March 2006 Amazon introduced the Simple Storage Service. These products are pioneering the use of server virtualization to deliver cheaper, on-demand IaaS

2010s In February 2010, Microsoft released Microsoft Azure, which was announced in October 2008. In July 2010, Rackspace Hosting and NASA jointly launched an open-source cloud software initiative known as OpenStack. The OpenStack project is intended to assist organizations that offer cloud computing services running on standard hardware. Initial code comes from NASA's Nebula platform as well as from Rackspace's File Cloud platform. As an open source offering and in conjunction with other open source solutions such as CloudStack, Ganeti, and OpenNebula, it has caught the attention of several major communities. Several studies aim to compare these open source offerings based on a set of criteria

Cloud computing has the same characteristics as:

Client-server model—Client-server computing refers broadly to distributed applications that distinguish between service providers (servers) and service requesters
Fog computing—A distributed computing paradigm that provides data, compute, storage, and application services closer to the client or user's near edge devices, such as network routers
